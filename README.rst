Openfst-Python Documentation for Automatic Speech Recognition Course INFR 11033 Labs
=======================================

This repo contains the files for building the documentation for openfst-python.

There is an `official documentation <https://www.openfst.org/twiki/bin/view/FST/PythonExtension>`_ for openfst-python actually, but it may not be very suitable and sufficient for the students in our labs, and that's why we have a separate documentation here as a complement. 

To view the webpage, please go to the `documentation webpage <https://openfst-python-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#>`_.
