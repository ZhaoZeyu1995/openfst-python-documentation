Welcome to openfst-python documentation!
===================================

For basic usage, please refer to the `official documentation <https://www.openfst.org/twiki/bin/view/FST/PythonExtension>`_.

This documentation is designed as a complement for the official one, as you may find that the latter is not that comprehensive.

.. note::

   This project is under active development.

.. note::

   Please have a look at :doc:`sample` first for some syntax examples if you would like to edit this documentation.

There are mainly two parts in this documentation.

The first part :doc:`tutorial` contains most of the frequently used functions and methods in our labs, just in case you are not that familiar with these and you may think the official documentation is not that sufficient for you.
The second part :doc:`api` lists almost all of the functions, classes (including their methods and attributes), which can be also be found by the :python:`help()` function.

>>> help(object) # object represents an abitary object here in openfst_python
