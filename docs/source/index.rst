Welcome to Edinburgh's openfst-python documentation
===================================

This documentation is intended for students working on our `ASR Labs <https://github.com/ZhaoZeyu1995/asr_labs>`_.  We previously received feedback that `official documentation the <https://www.openfst.org/twiki/bin/view/FST/PythonExtension>`_ can be hard to follow, so this is intended as a complement to it. 

Documentation of specific functions has been automatically derived from the code, but we have added our own explanations and examples.

.. note::

   The documentation is currently under active development.

.. COMMENT note::

   Please have a look at :doc:`sample` first for some syntax examples if you would like to edit this documentation.

You can use this documentation in two ways.

The :doc:`tutorial` section contains technical documentation of most of the frequently used functions and methods used in each lab session.

The :doc:`api` section lists almost all of the functions and classes (including their methods and attributes) used in openfst-python.   The contents can be also be viewed in Python by using the :python:`help()` function.
